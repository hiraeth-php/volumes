	; constructor -- `__construct()` -- .  Note the names need to match the parameter names.  If a

	; etc, for it to be resolved by the dependency injector.

		; The local cache path.  This can increase the speed of accessing assets on remote volumes
		; by storing a local copy.  Note, that `CACHING` must be set to `true` in the `.env`.  If
		; left empty, the default path will be `storage/cache/volumes/<name>`
